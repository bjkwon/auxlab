callback function [out1, out2,...] = cbfunc(in)
// returns to the caller workspace
in.fs
in.data // new incoming data buffer
in.dev
in.id
in.index // cumulative index from 0 (when the first callback started) since the beginning

all variables in this function is static--lingers around between callbacks 
for a given unique in.id

For stereo recording, callback occurs after BOTH channels are filled.

in the calling scope,
[x1,x2]=record(devID).callback

if the output variable is deleted or goes out of scope from the calling scope, the callback will terminate

x=record
x=record(0)
x=record(0,"callback")
x=record(0,"callback",2000) // record for 2000 ms 
x=record(0,"callback",2000,2) // stetero
x=record(0,"callback",2000,2,500) // the default callback block size is from the setting file (.ini) 

h=recorder(0,"callback",2000,2,500)

y=h.start
y=h.pause
y=h.resume
y=h.stop

h = init_record(devID, "callback", 2, 250)
res = h.record(2000) // record 2 secondsh = record(-1) // record indefinitely until stop is called
res = h.stop // stop it


The first callback (WIM_OPEN) =============
in.fs -- sample rate
in.dev -- device ID
in.id -- a random value
in.index = 0

Second callback (the first from WIM_DATA, maybe the second for stereo) =============
in.data -- CVar object
