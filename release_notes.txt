[bug fx] wavwrite with chain
[bug fx] filtfilt, AddChain, printf 
[bug fx] end corruption
[bug fx] fwrite with uint8/uin16/uint32, fread, not the same as original
[bug fx] incorrect nargin when used with dot func for udf
[bug fx] length(cell_obj)
[bug fx] cell_obj ++= RHS

[bug fx] set path dialogbox not closed after "OK" pressed
[bug fx] sample rate not saved into .ini
[policy] TSEQ objects arithmetic operations conditions polished 
   when x and y are TSEQ objects, a is a non-TSEQ scalar
   * x + a or x * a makes a TSEQ object
   * x + y or x * y makes sense only if time grids of x and y are the same
[policy] If a stereo TSEQ object is chainless and symmetrical (i.e., left and right the same), the object discards tmark and becomes a non-TSEQ scalar object, when it is an operand of operations or an argument of a function.
[policy] .ini header "EXT MODULES" lists additional extension dlls 
[fcn feat] wave(filename,readfrom_ms[=0],dur2read_ms[=-1;read_til_end])
[dev notes] str2vector introduced in bjcommon
[bug fx] AUXLib:Crashes when AUXPlay is called 
[bug fx] AUXLib:Plays twices when AUXPlay is called
[Release Build] AUXLib:Debugging enabled in the release build
[AUXLAB feat] Improvement in the error message display. Fixed unnecessary "Usage: ..." for example,
    1) Built-in func call with proper syntax/usage(e.g., wave calling with an unavailable file)
	   --> enum ERR_POST_FNC type added for CAstException
    2) Undefined variable 
       --> enum UNDEFINED_TID added

[bug fx] [$i 5] crashes. Show_WS_CommandPrompt edited inside the block, if (p->str && ((AstNode*)p->str)->type == N_VECTOR); add: if (pcast->lhs)
[bug fx] past->pEnv->builtin.find to be changed to past->pEnv->pseudo_vars.find in sharps.cpp (but get_first_arg is no longer needed in these functions)
[bug found] [x -y] computes to a scalar x-y, not a two-element array
