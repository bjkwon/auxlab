[bug fx] dir("\temp\") did not correctly show path of each file

11:05 AM 2/28/2022
When building after cloning github, (Debug), initially bjcommon.lib and sndlib1.0.28_st.lib not found error,
but a successive build (F7) worked

[bug fx] After [x,y,z]=max(something) gives an error, a subsequent call [x]=max(something) crashes
