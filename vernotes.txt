[policy] TSEQ objects arithmetic operations conditions polished 
   when x and y are TSEQ objects, a is a non-TSEQ scalar
   * x + a or x * a makes a TSEQ object
   * x + y or x * y makes sense only if time grids of x and y are the same
[policy] If a stereo TSEQ object is chainless and symmetrical (i.e., left and right the same), the object discards tmark and becomes a non-TSEQ scalar object, when it is an operand of operations or an argument of a function.
