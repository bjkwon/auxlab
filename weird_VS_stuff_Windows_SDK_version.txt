In VS2017, Windows SDK Version needs to be specifically defined, such as

<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>10.0.16299.0</WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>

in either *.vcxproj file or *.props globally.

In my PC (running VS2017), Windows SDK version shows 4 choices:
10.0.16299.0
10.0.15063.0
10.0.17763.0
8.0

If it was set generically as 10.0, it gives the following error: 

error MSB8036: The Windows SDK version 10.0 was not found. Install the required version of Windows SDK or change the SDK version in the project property pages or by right-clicking the solution and selecting "Retarget solution".

In another machin running VS2019, Windows SDK version shows 4 choices:
10.0 (latest installed version)
10.0.18362.0
8.1

Here, selecting 10.0 (latest installed version) works just fine. It appears as follows in *.vcxproj

<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>10.0</WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>
