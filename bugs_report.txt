Title: end_corruption
When x is audio and a is scalar
x(a(1)~end) should be whatever value of a til the end of x.
But, "end" which is supposed to be x.dur is corrupted and updated to 1 because that's the end of a, while t1 and t2 in x(t1~t2) were processed
Another example with a non-audio x
x=1:10
a=8
x(a(1):end)
