eval_indexing appears in 

* TID_indexing
case 1
	a=(1:24).group(4); k=1:size(a,1); 
	a(k%2==0,:)=5
	a([2 end],[1 4 end]) = -..
case 2
	a=1:10
	a(3:5)=[6 1 8]

* ExtractByIndex
	a=1:10
	b=a(8:end)

* TID_condition
I thought TID_condition would be used here
	a=rand(10)
	b=a(a>.5)
	a(a>.5)=0
but it's not. what's going on? When is TID_condition used?
	
* insertreplace
eval_indexing appears here, but this is not a core (just added to cover an unexpected case, not part of the central flow)
